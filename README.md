# Stock Market Price Prediction using LSTM

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The implementation is based on historical stock data of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and utilizes deep learning techniques to forecast future stock prices.

## Features
- Uses Yahoo Finance API to fetch stock prices.
- Preprocesses data with MinMaxScaler.
- Implements an LSTM model using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Evaluates performance using MAE, MSE, and RMSE.
- Visualizes actual vs. predicted prices.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Yahoo Finance API
